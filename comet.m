%  Be sure to include axis labels, a title, and a legend. Then, save it as

%% 3. Approximate when Halley's comet will return
%  a. TODO: Approximate perihelion
%  The best opportunities to view a comet are generally when it
%  is close to perihelion - its closest position to the sun. To determine
%  the next perihelion, compute the distance from the sun at each point
%  in the ephemeris you loaded for Halley's comet. Given that the sun is
%  defined to be at position (0,0,0), the distance formula is:
%       dist = sqrt(x .^ 2 + y .^ 2 + z .^ 2)
%  where x, y, and z are vectors of the coordinates of Halley's comet at
%  each point along its ephemeris.

dist = sqrt(ephemerides.XPosHalley.^2+ephemerides.YPosHalley.^2+ephemerides.ZPosHalley.^2);

%  b. TODO: Find min distance & date
%  Once you have computed the distance, find the minimum distance as well
%  as the index at which it occurs. That index can be plugged back into
%  your computed decimal years vector to determine the corresponding date
%  at which the perihelion occurs.

[minDist,index] = min(dist);
dateClosest = decimalYear(index);
